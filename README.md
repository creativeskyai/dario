## What it is

Dario runs on your machine and gives every tool you use one local URL that reaches **every LLM you use.** Point Cursor, Continue, Aider, LiteLLM, your own scripts — anything that speaks the Anthropic or OpenAI API — at `http://localhost:3456`, and dario routes each request to the right backend:

- **Claude Max / Pro subscriptions** — OAuth-backed, billed against your plan instead of API pricing. Multi-account pooling if you have more than one.
- **OpenAI** — your API key, routed to `api.openai.com` straight through.
- **Any OpenAI-compat endpoint** — OpenRouter, Groq, a local LiteLLM, Ollama's openai-compat mode, self-hosted vLLM. Set the backend's `baseUrl` once, done.

Your tool sees one base URL. `gpt-4` goes to OpenAI. `claude-opus-4-6` goes to your Claude subscription. `llama-3-70b` goes to Groq. None of your tools have to know about any of it.

**No account anywhere is required.** Single-backend Claude dario works with nothing but `dario login`. Multi-backend dario works with nothing but local config files. Nothing phones home. Zero runtime dependencies. ~2,000 lines of TypeScript.

---

## Who this is for

**Best fit:**

- **Developers using multiple LLMs across multiple tools** who are tired of juggling base URLs, API keys, and per-tool provider configs.
- **Claude Max or Pro subscribers** who want their subscription usable anywhere that speaks the Anthropic or OpenAI API — without paying API rates for every request.
- **Teams running local or hosted OpenAI-compat servers** (LiteLLM, vLLM, Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter) who want one stable local endpoint in front of them that every tool can reuse.
- **Power users running multi-agent workloads on Claude subscriptions** who want multi-account pooling with headroom-aware routing on their own machine, against their own subscriptions, without a hosted platform.

**Not a fit:**

- You need vendor-managed production SLAs on every request. Use the provider APIs directly.
- You need a hosted multi-tenant routing platform with a dashboard. Try [askalf](https://askalf.org), a separate product in the same family — different problem, different tool.
- You want a chat UI. Use claude.ai or chatgpt.com.

---

## First use case

> I install dario, point every tool I already use at `http://localhost:3456`, and every LLM I have access to works through that one URL.

Flow on a fresh machine:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @askalf/dario

# Optional: log in to your Claude subscription (Max or Pro)
dario login

# Optional: add an OpenAI-compat backend
dario backend add openai --key=sk-proj-...

# Start the proxy
dario proxy

# Use it — set these once, every tool that honors them just works
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dario
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=dario
```

Now from the same Cursor/Continue/Aider instance:

- `gpt-4o` → OpenAI, your key, straight through
- `claude-opus-4-6` → Claude subscription, billed against your Max plan
- `opus` → shortcut, same as above
- `llama-3.1-70b` on OpenRouter → configure `dario backend add openrouter --key=sk-or-... --base-url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, done

One URL. Your tool doesn't know or care which provider is answering.

---

## Why switch

**Use dario if** you use more than one LLM provider, or more than one tool, or both — and you're tired of configuring each tool with a different base URL and API key per provider.

**Use dario if** you pay for Claude Max or Pro and you want that subscription reachable from every tool on your machine, without paying API rates or opening a second billing surface.

**Use dario pool mode if** you're running multi-agent workloads on Claude subscriptions and hitting per-account rate limits. Add 2–N accounts with `dario accounts add` and dario routes across them by per-account headroom, all on your machine, against your own subscriptions. See [Multi-Account Pool Mode](#multi-account-pool-mode).

**Use a provider API directly if** you need vendor-managed production SLAs or high-scale orchestration primitives the providers ship themselves. Dario isn't trying to replace their APIs — it's trying to put one local shim in front of all of them so your tools don't care which is which.

**Don't use dario if** you want a subprocess bridge that shells out to `claude --print` under the hood (openclaw-claude-bridge and similar). That's a valid answer for single-team single-machine workloads that can accept a one-subscription rate ceiling and a one-machine deployment — different tradeoffs, different tool.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @askalf/dario

# Claude subscription path (detects Claude Code credentials if CC is installed,
# runs its own OAuth flow otherwise)
dario login

# OpenAI or any OpenAI-compat provider (optional, additive)
dario backend add openai --key=sk-proj-...

# Start the proxy
dario proxy

# Point anything that speaks the Anthropic or OpenAI API at localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dario
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=dario
```

Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, GPT-4o, o1, o3, o4, plus anything the configured OpenAI-compat backend serves. Streaming, tool use, prompt caching, extended thinking. **Zero runtime dependencies.** Auto-launches under [Bun](https://bun.sh) when available for TLS fingerprint fidelity with Claude Code's runtime on the Claude path.

---

## Backends

Dario's routing is organized around **backends**, each with its own auth and its own target. v3.6.0 ships two backends, with more coming.

### 1. Claude subscription backend (built in)

OAuth-backed Claude Max / Pro, billed against your plan instead of the API. Activated by `dario login`.

**What it does:**

- Every request is replaced with a Claude Code template before it goes upstream — 25 tool definitions, 25KB system prompt, exact CC field order, exact beta headers, exact metadata structure. Only the conversation content is preserved. Anthropic's classifier sees what looks like a Claude Code session because, from the wire up, it *is* one — and that's what keeps your usage on subscription billing instead of Extra Usage.
- **Billing tag** reconstructed using CC's own algorithm: `x-anthropic-billing-header: cc_version=<version>.<build_tag>; cc_entrypoint=cli; cch=<5-char-hex>;` where `build_tag = SHA-256(seed + chars[4,7,20] of user message + version).slice(0,3)`.
- **OAuth config** auto-detected from the installed CC binary at startup. When Anthropic rotates `client_id`, authorize URL, or scopes, dario picks up the new values on the next run without needing a release.
- **Multi-account pool mode** — see below. Automatic when 2+ accounts are configured.
- **Framework scrubbing** — known fingerprint tokens (`OpenClaw`, `sessions_*` prefixes, orchestration tags) stripped from system prompt and message content before the request leaves your machine.
- **Bun auto-relaunch** — when Bun is installed, dario relaunches under it so the TLS fingerprint matches CC's runtime. Without Bun, dario runs on Node.js.

**Passthrough mode** (`dario proxy --passthrough`) does an OAuth swap and nothing else — no template, no identity, no scrubbing. Use it when the upstream tool already builds a Claude-Code-shaped request on its own and you just need the token auth.

**Detection scope.** The Claude backend is a per-request layer. Template replay and scrubbing are designed to be indistinguishable from Claude Code at the request level. What they *cannot* defend against is Anthropic's session-level behavioral classifier, which operates on cumulative per-OAuth aggregates (token throughput, conversation depth, streaming duration, inter-arrival timing). The practical answer to that is **pool mode** — distributing load across multiple subscriptions so no one account accumulates enough signal to trip anything. See the [FAQ entry](#faq) for the full mechanism.

### 2. OpenAI-compat backend (v3.6.0+)

Any provider that speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions API. Activated by:

```bash
# OpenAI itself (default base URL)
dario backend add openai --key=sk-proj-...

# Groq
dario backend add groq --key=gsk_... --base-url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1

# OpenRouter
dario backend add openrouter --key=sk-or-... --base-url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

# Local LiteLLM / vLLM / Ollama openai-compat mode
dario backend add local --key=anything --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1
```

Credentials live at `~/.dario/backends/<name>.json` with mode `0600`.

**How it routes.** When the OpenAI-compat backend is configured, each request at `/v1/chat/completions` is checked:

| Request model | Route |
|---|---|
| `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*`, `chatgpt-*`, `text-davinci-*`, `text-embedding-*` | OpenAI-compat backend |
| `claude-*` (or `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`) | Claude subscription backend |
| Anything else | Claude backend with OpenAI-compat translation |

Dario's passthrough for the OpenAI-compat backend is literal: client request body goes upstream as-is, only the `Authorization` header is swapped for the configured API key and the URL is pointed at `baseUrl + /chat/completions`. Response body streams back unchanged.

### Coming in a follow-up

- **Anthropic → OpenAI request translation** for `/v1/messages` requests with GPT-family model names (tool_use format, streaming delta conversion).
- **Multiple simultaneous openai-compat backends** with per-model routing rules (`gpt-*` → OpenAI, `llama-*` → Groq, `mixtral-*` → OpenRouter).
- **Fallback rules.** "If Claude 429s, use Gemini." v3.6.0 ships the routing plumbing; fallback logic layers on top.

---

## Multi-Account Pool Mode

*New in v3.5.0, for the Claude subscription backend.* Dario can manage multiple Claude subscriptions and route each request to the account with the most headroom. Single-account Claude dario is unchanged — pool mode activates **only** when `~/.dario/accounts/` contains 2+ accounts.

```bash
dario accounts add work
dario accounts add personal
dario accounts add side-project
dario accounts list
dario proxy
```

Each request picks the account with the highest headroom:

```
headroom = 1 - max(util_5h, util_7d)
```

The response's `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers are parsed back into the pool so the next selection sees fresh utilization. An account that returns a 429 is marked `rejected` and routed around until its window resets. When every account is exhausted, requests queue for up to 60 seconds waiting for headroom to reappear.

Accounts can mix plans — Max and Pro accounts can sit in the same pool; dario doesn't care about tier, only headroom.

**Pool inspection endpoints:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3456/accounts     # per-account utilization, claim, status
curl http://localhost:3456/analytics    # per-account / per-model stats, burn rate, exhaustion predictions
```

**Scope.** v3.5.0 ships headroom-aware selection *across* requests — a 429 on one request marks the account rejected and the next request goes to a different one. Retrying a single in-flight request against a different account when that request 429s (inside-request failover) ships in v3.5.1 along with analytics recording wiring.

## Usage

### Python (Anthropic SDK)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    base_url="http://localhost:3456",
    api_key="dario",
)

msg = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
```

### Python (OpenAI SDK — same proxy, different provider)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3456/v1",
    api_key="dario",
)

# gpt-4o routes to the configured OpenAI backend
msg = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)

# claude-opus-4-6 routes to the Claude subscription backend — same SDK, same URL
claude_msg = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
```

### TypeScript / Node.js

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const client = new Anthropic({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:3456",
  apiKey: "dario",
});

const msg = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-opus-4-6",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

### OpenAI-compatible tools (Cursor, Continue, Aider, LiteLLM, …)

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3456/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=dario
```

Any tool that accepts an OpenAI base URL works. Use Claude model names (`claude-opus-4-6`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) for the Claude backend, or GPT-family names for the configured OpenAI-compat backend.

### curl

```bash
# Claude backend via Anthropic format
curl http://localhost:3456/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

# OpenAI backend via OpenAI format
curl http://localhost:3456/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dario" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

### Streaming, tool use, prompt caching, extended thinking

All supported. Claude backend: full Anthropic SSE format plus OpenAI-SSE translation for tool_use streaming. OpenAI-compat backend: streaming body forwarded byte-for-byte.

### Library mode

```typescript
import { startProxy, getAccessToken, getStatus, listBackends } from "@askalf/dario";

await startProxy({ port: 3456, verbose: true });
const token = await getAccessToken();
const status = await getStatus();
const backends = await listBackends();
```

### Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3456/health
```

---

## Trust & Transparency

Dario handles your OAuth tokens and API keys locally. Here's why you can trust it:

| Signal | Status |
|---|---|
| **Source code** | ~2,500 lines of TypeScript across 10 files — small enough to audit in one sitting |
| **Dependencies** | 0 runtime dependencies. Verify: `npm ls --production` |
| **npm provenance** | Every release is [SLSA-attested](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@askalf/dario) via GitHub Actions |
| **Security scanning** | [CodeQL](https://github.com/askalf/dario/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) runs on every push and weekly |
| **Credential handling** | Tokens and API keys never logged, redacted from errors, stored with `0600` permissions |
| **OAuth flow** | PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), no client secret |
| **Network scope** | Binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. `--host` allows LAN/mesh with `DARIO_API_KEY` gating. Upstream traffic goes only to the configured backend target URLs over HTTPS |
| **SSRF protection** | `/v1/messages` hits `api.anthropic.com` only; `/v1/chat/completions` hits the configured backend `baseUrl` only — hardcoded allowlist |
| **Telemetry** | None. Zero analytics, tracking, or data collection |
| **Audit trail** | [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) documents every release |

Verify the npm tarball matches this repo:

```bash
npm audit signatures
npm view @askalf/dario dist.integrity
cd $(npm root -g)/@askalf/dario && npm ls --production
```

## FAQ

**Does this violate Anthropic's terms of service?**
Dario's Claude backend uses your existing Claude Code credentials with the same OAuth tokens CC uses. It authenticates you as you, with your subscription, through Anthropic's official API endpoints.

**What subscription plans work on the Claude backend?**
Claude Max and Claude Pro. Any plan that lets you use Claude Code.

**Does it work with Team / Enterprise?**
Should work if your plan includes Claude Code access. Not widely tested yet — open an issue with results.

**Do I need Claude Code installed?**
Recommended for the Claude backend, not strictly required. With CC installed, `dario login` picks up your credentials automatically. Without CC, dario runs its own OAuth flow against Anthropic's authorize endpoint.

**Do I need Bun?**
Optional, recommended for Claude-backend requests. Dario auto-relaunches under Bun when available so the TLS fingerprint matches CC's runtime. Without Bun, dario runs on Node.js and works fine; the TLS fingerprint is the only difference.

**First time setup on a fresh Claude account.**
If dario is the first thing you run against a brand-new Claude account, prime the account with a few real Claude Code commands first:
```bash
claude --print "hello"
claude --print "hello"
```
This establishes a session baseline. Without priming, brand-new accounts occasionally see billing classification issues on first use.

**What happens when Anthropic rotates the OAuth config?**
Dario auto-detects OAuth config from the installed Claude Code binary. When CC ships a new version with rotated values, dario picks them up on the next run. Cache at `~/.dario/cc-oauth-cache-v3.json`, keyed by the CC binary fingerprint. Falls back to hardcoded CC 2.1.104 prod values if CC isn't installed.

**I'm hitting rate limits on the Claude backend. What do I do?**
Claude subscriptions have rolling 5-hour and 7-day usage windows. Check utilization with Claude Code's `/usage` command or the [statusline](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline). For multi-agent workloads, add more accounts and let pool mode distribute the load: `dario accounts add <alias>`.

**My multi-agent workload is getting reclassified to overage even though dario template-replays per request. Why?**
Reclassification at high agent volume is not a per-request problem. Anthropic's classifier operates on cumulative per-OAuth-session aggregates — token throughput, conversation depth, streaming duration, inter-arrival timing, thinking-block volume. Dario's Claude backend can make each individual request indistinguishable from Claude Code and still hit this wall on a long-running agent session, because the wall isn't at the request level. Thorough diagnostic work on this was contributed by [@belangertrading](https://github.com/belangertrading) in [#23](https://github.com/askalf/dario/issues/23), including the v3.4.3/v3.4.5 hardening that landed as a result. The practical answer at the dario layer is **pool mode** — distribute load across multiple subscriptions so no single account accumulates enough signal to trip anything. See [Multi-Account Pool Mode](#multi-account-pool-mode).

**Can I route non-OpenAI providers through dario?**
Yes — anything that speaks the OpenAI Chat Completions API. `dario backend add groq --key=... --base-url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, `dario backend add openrouter --key=... --base-url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, or point at a local LiteLLM / vLLM / Ollama-openai-compat server with `--base-url=http://localhost:4000/v1`. v3.6.0 supports one active OpenAI-compat backend at a time; per-model routing to multiple OpenAI-compat backends ships in a follow-up.

**Does dario work with only the OpenAI backend, no Claude subscription?**
Yes. Don't run `dario login`, just run `dario backend add openai --key=...` and `dario proxy`. Claude-backend requests will return an authentication error; OpenAI-compat requests will work normally. Dario becomes a local OpenAI-compat shim with no Claude involvement.

**Why "dario"?**
It's a name, not an acronym. Don't overthink it.
